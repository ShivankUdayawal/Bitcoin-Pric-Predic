# Bitcoin Price Prediction
## Predicting the Bitcoin Price

## Introduction
#### Bitcoin is the first digital decentralized cryptocurrency that has shown a significant increase in market capitalization in recent years. The objective of this paper is to determine the predictable price direction of Bitcoin in USD by machine learning techniques and sentiment analysis.

#### Bitcoin is a global cryptocurrency and online payment system that is highly stable and secure. It is Peer-to-peer value transfer and transaction protocol. Bitcoin transactions are verified by network nodes, published on a public ledger. Highly stable and secure Decentralized verification (Blockchains). “Bitcoin” is the unit of account on this ledger. Smallest unit: a satoshi representing 0.00000001 bitcoin, one hundred millionths of a bitcoin. In 2017, the Bitcoin price rose from $900 at the beginning of the year to nearly $20000 at the end of the year.


## Problem Statements
   1. Bitcoin is the most complex cryptocurrency which value change in every second.
   2. Investing money for Bitcoin is more risk and less profit.
   3. Predicting the Bitcoin Price.

## Project Objectives
  1. To predict bitcoin price with maximum efficiency using LSTM and ARIMA.
  2. To compare between ARIMA and LSTM to find which is the best efficient algorithm for predicting bitcoin price.
  3. To ensure less risk and more profit for investors.
